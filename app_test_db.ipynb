(Picture: Reuters)ReutersTel Aviv,UPDATED: Jan 9, 2024 09:57 ISTPosted By: Ashutosh AcharyaUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to meet Israeli leaders on Tuesday in his quest to prevent the Gaza conflict from growing into a regional conflagration as the Israeli military said its fight against Hamas will rage all year.Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv late on Monday to brief Israeli officials on his two days of talks with Arab leaders on ending the war triggered by Hamas militants\\' attack on Israel that by Israeli tallies killed about 1,200 people on October 7.He also said that he would press Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s government \"on the absolute imperative to do more to protect civilians and to do more to make sure that humanitarian assistance is getting into the hands of those who need it.\"Israel must allow displaced Palestinian civilians to return to their homes in Gaza, Blinken said, in response to calls by right-wing members of Israel\\'s ruling coalition for them to move elsewhere.Israeli leaders will tell Blinken that they will not allow Palestinians from northern Gaza to return if Hamas refuses to free more of the Israeli hostages it seized on October 7, Axios reported, quoting two senior Israeli officials.The Israeli offensive has claimed more than 23,000 Palestinian lives, destroyed much of the tiny coastal enclave and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, creating a worsening humanitarian crisis.Netanyahu has vowed to pursue the drive until Hamas is destroyed. But he has come under growing pressure from the United States, his country\\'s closest ally, and Arab leaders to scale back the assault.US President Joe Biden, confronted on Monday by protesters shouting \"ceasefire now\" while visiting an historic Black church in South Carolina, said he had been \"quietly\" working to encourage Israel to ease its attacks and \"significantly get out of Gaza.\"Israeli officials have said the operation is entering a new phase of more targeted warfare, but there was no respite in the fighting on Monday.Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesperson, said a \"different mix of forces\" was pursuing holdout Hamas fighters in the north as \"intense operational activity\" focused on central Gaza and around the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Handling tough battles in both the center and south,\" Hagari said. \"The fighting will continue through 2024.\"Israeli forces bombarded the eastern part of Khan Younis and the central Gaza Strip amid ground clashes, residents said.Hamas\\'s military wing the Al-Qassam Brigades said its fighters fired missiles at Tel Aviv in response to what it called the \"Zionist massacres against civilians\".And in a further sign of the war spreading, Israel killed a top commander of Hamas\\' ally Hezbollah in south Lebanon on Monday, sources familiar with the group\\'s operations said.Blinken flew to Tel Aviv after talks in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to try to chart a way out of the bloodiest chapter ever of the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict. It is his fourth mission to the region since October.Speaking to reporters after meeting Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Saudi oasis town of Al Ula, Blinken said that he still found support among Arab leaders for Israel\\'s goal of normalising relations.But that will \"require that the conflict end in Gaza\" and \"a practical pathway to a Palestinian state,\" said Blinken, who held talks in Jordan and Qatar on Sunday.The Saudi crown prince, the kingdom\\'s de facto ruler, stressed the importance of stopping the hostilities and forging a path to peace, Saudi state news agency SPA reported.SPA said the crown prince - who, prior to the war\\'s outbreak, had been leading a rapprochement between his country and Israel - underscored the need to ensure the Palestinian people\\'s legitimate rights.Israel, which says it is in a fight for its very survival, accuses Hamas of operating among civilians. Hamas, which is sworn to Israel\\'s destruction, denies this.The Israeli offensive so far has killed 23,084 Palestinians, Gaza health officials say. Israel says Hamas still holds more than 100 hostages of the 240 seized in its attack on Israel.\\'DANGEROUS COMBAT ZONES\\'Jordan\\'s King Abdullah said on Monday that \"indiscriminate aggression\" and shelling could never bring peace or security.In remarks at the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda, he said: \"More children have died in Gaza than in all other conflicts around the world this past year. Of those who have survived, many have lost one or both parents, an entire generation of orphans.\"The Israeli military said it had bombed an arms cache and uncovered a tunnel shaft in central Gaza and killed at least 10 militant fighters in Khan Younis.It dropped leaflets on al Moghani in central Gaza warning residents to evacuate several districts it said were \"dangerous combat zones.\" Hamas said a sniper had killed an Israeli soldier in central Gaza.Nearly all of Gaza\\'s residents have fled their homes at least once and many remain on the move, often sheltering in makeshift tents or under tarpaulins.For Aziza Abbas, 57, camped close to the southern border with Egypt, there was nowhere else to go after what she said was bombing around a school in which she had taken shelter after leaving her home in the north.\"They may kill us here, it doesn\\'t matter to them,\" she told Reuters, saying she did not want to leave Gaza for Egypt, which has closed the border fearing an exodus.Published By: Ashutosh AcharyaPublished On: Jan 9, 2024Tune InALSO READ |  Israel says big arms unit found in Gaza, new clip of Hamas invading Israel emergesMust Watch \\nadvertisementIN THIS STORY#IsraelWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso Watch34:20Is Lakshadweep ready to become tourist hotspot?

The war began after Palestinian group Hamas launched an attack on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7, killing at least 1,200 people. The number of men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners held captive in Gaza by Hamas is now believed to be 129. Other people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains. In retaliation, Israel launched several strikes on Gaza. The Israeli offensive has claimed more than 23,000 Palestinian lives, destroyed much of the tiny coastal enclave and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, creating a worsening humanitarian crisis. Israeli military officials said at least 170 soldiers had been killed during the country\\'s ground invasion of Gaza.Here\\'s a list of the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war.\\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel would continue its operation to wipe out the Hamas group. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, \"We will continue to operate against Hamas leaders, and today we also targeted a series of Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, including military sites belonging to the organisation. We responded with fire to areas from which launches were identified toward Israeli territory. As we have stated since the beginning of the war, we will not tolerate a threat near the northern border. We said it, and we mean it.\"\\nadvertisementUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Tuesday ahead of key meetings with Israeli officials. On Monday, he said Palestinians \"must not be pressed to leave Gaza\" and he criticised \"irresponsible\" comments by some Israeli ministers calling for people\\'s resettlement outside the enclave. \\nIsrael killed a top Hezbollah commander in a strike in south Lebanon on Monday, sources familiar with the group\\'s operations said, inflicting a heavy blow after three months of hostilities on the Lebanese-Israeli frontier. Wissam Tawil was a commander of Hezbollah\\'s elite Radwan forces and the most senior Hezbollah officer killed so far in the conflict, a senior source in Lebanon said, adding he played a leading role in directing its operations in the south.\\nOn another urgent diplomatic mission to the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Arab partners to press for their help in tamping down resurgent fears that Israel’s three-month war against Hamas in Gaza could spread. In discussions with Qatar’s emir and Jordan’s king, Blinken spoke of the need for Israel to adjust its military operations to reduce civilian casualties and significantly boost the amount of humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, while stressing the importance of preparing detailed plans for the post-conflict future of the Palestinian territory, which has been decimated by Israeli bombardments. Blinken was warned by Middle East leaders that anti-US opinion was growing in the region over support for Israel. \\nUS President Joe Biden said he\\'d been quietly working to persuade the Israeli government to reduce or \"significantly get out of Gaza.\" However, Israel has been continuing to ramp up its ground offensive in central and southern Gaza, even as Israeli officials are saying forces will shift to a new phase of fighting. \\nPublished By: Poulami KunduPublished On: Jan 9, 2024Tune InALSO READ  |  \\'Fauda\\' actor Idan Amedi injured in battle in Gaza, says Israeli diplomatMust Watch \\nWatch Live TV AdvertisementAlso Watch34:20Is Lakshadweep ready to become tourist hotspot?

(Photo: Reuters)India Today World DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Jan 9, 2024 08:50 ISTWritten By: Poulami KunduIsraeli forces said they had located the largest weapons production site in Gaza that had underground workshops used to produce long-range missiles capable of hitting targets in northern Israel.The military said the workshops also produced copies or adaptations of standard munitions, such as mortar shells, and were connected through underground shafts to a tunnel network used to transport the weapons to fighting units throughout the Gaza Strip.advertisementMeanwhile, an Israeli channel has aired 30 minutes of new footage uncovered from the GoPro cameras of Hamas operatives, showing the early hours of the terror group’s October 7 attack.The footage shows how Hamas terrorists managed to break through the fences, barriers, and walls along the Gaza border and ride into Israel in cars and motorcycles to carry out mass murder on the other side of the border without being questioned by Israeli security forces in minutes.\\nThe Israel-Hamas war entered Day 95 on Tuesday. The war began after Palestinian group Hamas launched an attack on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7, killing at least 1,200 people. The number of men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners held captive in Gaza by Hamas is now believed to be 129. Other people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains. In retaliation, Israel launched several strikes on Gaza. The Israeli offensive has claimed more than 23,000 Palestinian lives, destroyed much of the tiny coastal enclave and displaced most of the population of 2.3 million, creating a worsening humanitarian crisis. Israeli military officials said at least 170 soldiers had been killed during the country\\'s ground invasion of Gaza.Here\\'s a list of the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war.\\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) said Israel would continue its operation to wipe out the Hamas group. IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said, \"We will continue to operate against Hamas leaders, and today we also targeted a series of Hezbollah targets across southern Lebanon, including military sites belonging to the organisation.

Other people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains. In retaliation, Israel launched several strikes on Gaza.

(Picture: Reuters)ReutersNew York,UPDATED: Jan 9, 2024 09:56 ISTPosted By: Ashutosh AcharyaPro-Palestinian protesters blocked several New York City bridges and a tunnel on Monday to demand an immediate ceasefire in the three-month-old Israel-Hamas conflict before police arrested hundreds of them and reopened the roadways.Dozens of chanting demonstrators sat at entrances to the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges across the East River, as well as at the Holland Tunnel connecting New York City with New Jersey across the Hudson River, local media reported.Police arrested 325 demonstrators, a New York Police Department spokesperson said, and all the locations were cleared before noon.New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the right to protest does not give people the right to block bridges.\"The goal is to peacefully protest without causing major disruption to the city. Some people are not just driving to and from, across our bridges to go to their place of employment, some of them are dealing with some real emergency-type issues,\" Adams said.Video posted on social media during the protests showed demonstrators chanting: \"NYPD, KKK, IDF they’re all the same,\" referring to the New York Police Department, Ku Klux Klan and the Israel Defense Forces.Protesters at the Holland Tunnel carried banners that said \"Lift the siege on Gaza,\" \"Ceasefire Now\" and \"End the occupation.\"The protests were organised by Jewish Voice for Peace, the Palestinian Youth Movement and the New York chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, among other advocacy groups, they said on social media app X.\"The siege on Gaza needs to end, and I\\'m ready to put my body on the line to end it,\" said one protester as she was led away by a police officer with her hands behind her back, video showed.In Charleston, South Carolina, protesters interrupted President Joe Biden\\'s re-election campaign speech at the Mother Emanuel AME Church where a white supremacist killed nine Black church people in 2015.The protesters chanted \"Ceasefire now,\" and the congregation inside the church responded with a chorus of \"four more years\" while the demonstrators were ushered out of the building.\"I\\'ve been quietly working, quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza,\" Biden said after his speech was interrupted.Israel\\'s campaign in Hamas-run Gaza has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, local health officials say, while Israel says Hamas holds more than 100 hostages of 240 seized during its October 7 attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed.Israel accuses Hamas of operating among civilians and has released videos and photos it says support the claim.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is currently in Israel, meeting with Israeli leaders in an effort to prevent the war from escalating further. He has emphasized the need for Israel to do more to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian assistance reaches those in need. Meanwhile, Israel has announced the discovery of a large arms unit in Gaza, which was reportedly producing long-range missiles and other munitions. This discovery highlights the ongoing threat posed by Hamas and the need for Israel to defend itself. In New York, pro-Palestinian protesters have been arrested for blocking bridges and demanding an immediate ceasefire. The conflict has also drawn international attention, with Houthi leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi justifying their involvement in the Israel-Gaza war in an interview with BBC Arabic. The situation in Gaza remains volatile, with no immediate resolution in sight.
