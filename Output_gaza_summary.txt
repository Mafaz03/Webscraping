The situation in Gaza remains dire as the Israel-Hamas war continues. Life-saving aid for Palestinians is piling up at the border, causing delays in the delivery of essential supplies. Trucks from organizations such as UNICEF, Red Cross, and World Health Organization are stranded at the border crossing at Rafah, the only point of entry for relief. The Palestinian people are experiencing unprecedented levels of hunger, with some resorting to taking food directly from trucks out of desperation.

The war has also had a profound impact on the lives of journalists in Gaza. Plestia Alaqad, a 22-year-old Palestinian journalist, had once aimed to showcase the beauty of Gaza through her Instagram posts but found herself reporting on the war instead. The trauma of witnessing the conflict firsthand has left a lasting mark on her.

Amidst the crisis, the UAE has been delivering 1.2 million gallons of water daily to Gaza through its desalination mission, providing some relief to the suffering population.

The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has resulted in significant destruction and loss of life in Gaza. The conflict has also seen the involvement of other nations, with the US issuing a final warning to Houthi rebels in Yemen after a drone attack on ships in the Red Sea. In response, the US sank three ships and killed 10 Houthi rebels. Israel has also been engaged in the conflict, striking down two drones launched by an Iran-backed Iraqi militia and conducting fresh airstrikes in central Gaza, resulting in the deaths of 35 people.

The need for a peaceful resolution to the situation in Gaza is becoming increasingly urgent. The international community continues to monitor developments closely.
