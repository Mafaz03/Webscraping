The situation in Gaza is currently tense and volatile. There has been an ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, for many years. The recent escalation in violence began in early May 2021, with clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian protesters in Jerusalem. This led to rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. The violence has resulted in the deaths of both Israelis and Palestinians, including many civilians, and has caused significant damage to infrastructure in Gaza. The international community has called for an immediate ceasefire and for both sides to de-escalate the situation. The United Nations and other organizations are working to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. For more detailed and up-to-date information, you can refer to news sources such as the Khaleej Times website (https://www.khaleejtimes.com/world).

Currently, there is a crisis in Gaza as Israel and Hamas continue to engage in a war. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim, has called on the UN Security Council to intervene and force Israel to return to the negotiating table. He has criticized the international community for its inaction in halting the conflict. The President of the UAE has also stressed the need for a ceasefire in Gaza to protect civilians and provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the war. Meanwhile, in the midst of the conflict, hunger has become a pressing issue for both animals and people in Gaza, with reports of animals dying in a zoo due to lack of food. Israel has announced the withdrawal of some troops from Gaza, but the military expects the war to continue throughout 2024. In a positive development, the UAE has opened desalination plants in Rafah to pump water to Gaza, benefiting over 600,000 people. Despite the hopes for peace in the new year, the conflict in Gaza seems to be escalating, with an Israeli minister even calling for Palestinians to leave Gaza.
